# Remote Text Recognition Using Firebase's "onDevice" Text Recognizer

An android application which uses Firebase's "onDevice" Text Recognizer to detect and recognize texts in an image.

No usable activity. It gets the image through socket and sends the results back as *json object*.

It uses sockets to connect. An example usage can be found in the [client.py](client.py) script.

I'm not expert on Java sockets. Therefore, I guess more efficient connection might be established.
